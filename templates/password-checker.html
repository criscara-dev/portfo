    <h1>The Python password checker</h1>
    <br>
    <img src="../static/assets/haveibeenpawned-resized.png" alt="Have I been Pawned website homepage">
  <p>The idea and purpose behind this Python project is let you check if your passwords have been leaked in the past without compromise your security.</p>
      <p>For this purpose you could have just used the popular website: <em><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a></em> that let you check if your email or password has been pawned.üò±</p><br>
      <p>While I don't have any concern to enter my email in their website, what about my password? ü§î <br>
      Personally, I don't think it is always a good idea to send my password over the internet.<br>
       Even if the website connection is secure, when I press submit my password is sent through the internet to the website server and someone could be on the middle and intercepted it.
      As a developers, we can create secure and free way to achieve our goal and it involves some coding.<br>
      Obviously, there are many service out there that under the hood has implemented this type of check like 1passord, Keeper, Sticky Password etc.<br>
      So, the more secure way to doing it is built a password checker using the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3">haveibeenpwned</a> Password API.</p>

<h2>Building a password checker in Python</h2>
  <p>First we need to import some modules from the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html'>Python Standard Library</a></p>
  <p>The <strong><em>request</em></strong>: to be able to request data via the internet</p>
The <strong><em>hashlib</em></strong>: to hash a password since we don't want to send over the internet our password.
  <pre>
    <code >
    import requests
    import hashlib
    import sys # to remove after the version 1.0.1
    </code>
  </pre>
<p>Our first function is the one that we need to establish a connection to the API and get a response from the server based on our query:
</p>  
<pre><code >
  def request_api_data(query_char):
      url =  'https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/' >+ query_char
      res = requests. get (url)
      # check
      if res.status_code != 200 :
          raise RuntimeError( f'Error fetching {res.status_code}, check the API and try again' )
      return res 
  </code></pre>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Short intro to <strong>Hashing</strong></h3>
  <p>A security step in building our solution.<br>
  The ideas is not to send over the internet the real password, in fact you should never store user password to a DB without hashing it first;
  Since we're using the Password API, and we want to use a 'fast' encryption algorithm, we will used the SHA1.<br>
  Ex.<a href="https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha1-hash-generator/">Sha1 hash generator</a>
  password123 = CBFDAC6008F9CAB4083784CBD1874F76618D2A97 in SHA1.</p>

  <p><strong><b>Hashing is idempotent</b></strong>, or let's say, it's like a Pure function: giving the same input (password) it always return the same value (hash)</p>

  <h3>The query parameter</h3>
  <p>Plus, to improve anonimity, instead of give to the API the entire hash of a password, we just gave a little bit of it, just the first 5 characters.<br>
  We are applying here a 'key anonimity technique' to dont give away our personal information.</p>
  <p><strong><b>The idea here is to give only the first 5 characters of the hashed password and the API send us back a list of all hashed 'leaked' passwords starting with those 5 characters.
  On our side we can then check the 'tail' left of our hashed password against the list we got from the query (if it has been leaked).</strong></b></p>

  <p>At this point we can implement the functions that are going to process the data and giving us an output, if found.</p>
  <p>We need to create a function to read the response.<br>
  This function check the tail of the hashed password against the list and look for how many times have been hacked.
  </p>
  <pre><code > def pwned_api_check (password): 
  # Check the password if it exists in API response using the haslib library
      sha1password = hashlib.sha1(password.encode( 'utf-8' )).hexdigest().upper()
      first5_chars,tail = sha1password[:], sha1password[ >5 :]
      # here we pass the first 5 chars for the check on the hashed password 
      response = request_api_data(first5_chars)
      return get_password_leak_count(response,tail)

  # Underneath a temporarely function just to check we get the hashed version of leaked passwords, don't use it in production! üòÖ 
  # this function is going to be replaced with: get_password_leak_count() 
  def read_response(response):
      print(response.text)
    # Ex. expected results in the format: &lt;hashed passwords&gt;:&lt;number of time the password has been leaked&gt;
    # FHSEU347RG23HYGJ432Y3253BBNN:2 
    # FHSEUGFYW4G55H432Y325748HBFF:4 
    # XHUAQIW3B4IR78YE3TF483CUIFHG:1 
    # ... 
  
  </code></pre>
  <pre><code >
  # left to implement
  def get_password_leak_count (hashes, hash_to_check):
      pass
      # check if the password exist in the API response 
  </code></pre>
  <h3>Implementing: get_password_leak_count()</h3>
  <pre><code >def get_password_leak_count(hashes, hash_to_check):
      # this line to get a 'tuple comprehension' that has the number of leaks for hash
      hashes = ( line.split ( ':' ) for line in hashes.text.splitlines())
      for h, count in hashes: 
          #  print (h,count ) # Expected: XHUAQIW3B4IR78YE3TF483CUIFHG  1 
          # now we need to check from all the hashes leaked if mine is there (I do not provive this to the service, is only on my machine)
          if h == hash_to_check: # hash_to_check  is stored securely in the 'tail' parameter in the  previous function
              return count 
      return 0 
  </code></pre>

  <h3>Last, we need to create a main fuction that is going to receive the arguments that we give in the terminal</h3>
  <pre><code >def main(args):
      for password in args: 
          count  = pwned_api_check(password)
          if count: 
              print(f'{password} was found {count} times... Yout should change your password!')
          else:
              print(f'{password} NOT found. You are good to go!')
      return 'done.'
  </code></pre>
<br>
  <p>Last but not the least,
  we are passing our password in the Terminal and this information is stored in our machine memory (try arrow up üòß ), and this is not super secure. 
  <br> So, if we want to be completely safe against possible attacks, we can read passwords from a text file.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Implementing the password checker using a text file.</h3>
  <p>To achieve that, we can comment out our function main() and create a new function that is reading a single/list of passwords from a txt file and pass it as a argument into the checking function.</p>
  <pre>
        <code >
      with open ('pass.txt') as password s: 
          # skip first line of instructions
          next (passwords)
          list_passwords = [line.rstrip('\n')  for line in passwords]
          #  print (list_passwords)
          for password in list_passwords: 
              count  = pwned_api_check(password)
              if count: 
                  print ( f'{password} was found {count} times... Yout should change your password!' )
              else:
                  print(f'{password} NOT found. You are good to go!')
      </code>
  </pre>

      <p>I think security is not always considered a top priority for some people but for me is paramount.<br>
          The code in Github is available to fork and for further implementations.
          I built an offline tool that I am using quite often and I enjoyed the building process, using different Python libraries and API service.
